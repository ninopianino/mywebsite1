    <article>While attending his second year at CalArts in 1992, series creator Craig McCracken created a short film, Whoopass Stew!, about a trio of child superheroes called the Whoopass Girls, which was only shown at festivals. Following a name change to Powerpuff Girls, McCracken submitted his student film to Cartoon Network, who aired the series' refined pilot in its animation showcase program World Premiere Toons on February 20, 1995, along with its follow-up, "Crime 101", which aired on January 28, 1996. Network executives gave McCracken the greenlight for a full series, which debuted as a Cartoon Cartoon on November 18, 1998.</article>

<h2>premise</h2>
<article>The show revolves around the adventures of three kindergarten-aged girls with an array of various superpowers: Blossom (pink), Bubbles (blue), and Buttercup (green). The plot of an episode is usually some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu shows, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, the girls have to deal with the normal issues that young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth,[7] personal hygiene,[8] going to school, bed wetting,[9] or dependence on a security blanket.[10] Episodes often contain hidden references to older pop culture (especially noticeable in the episode "Meet the Beat Alls",[11] which is a homage to the Beatles). The cartoon always tries to keep different ideas within each episode with some small tributes and parodies thrown in.[12] <br>
    The show is set mainly in the city of Townsville, USA. Townsville is depicted as a major American city, with a cityscape consisting of several major skyscrapers. In his review of The Powerpuff Girls Movie, movie critic Bob Longino of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said, "the intricate drawings emanate 1950s futuristic pizzazz like a David Hockney scenescape," and that the show is "one of the few American creations that is both gleeful pop culture and exquisite high art."[13]
